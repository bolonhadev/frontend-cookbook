# Github Pipeline with Travis Set-up

We deploy Github based repositories with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and it needs to be set up properly with commands described below.

## Set-up

1.  **Create project on Github** - we use Github for all our opensource projects/libraries
    - Create project as public
    - Project has to be located under [AckeeCZ team](https://github.com/AckeeCZ)
2.  **Modify package.json to allow scoped packages**

    - ```js
        "publishConfig": {
          "access": "public"
        }
      ```
    - don’t forget to set the name with scope prefix -> @ackee/jerome

3.  **Create Travis account**
    - Sign up - [https://travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) - **.com domain is very IMPORTANT**
    - Join [AckeeCZ team](https://travis-ci.com/organizations/AckeeCZ)
4.  **Create Travis CI**
    - Go to your [travis repositories](https://travis-ci.com/organizations/AckeeCZ/repositories)
    - Choose AckeeCZ organization on the left bar
    - Click -> Manage repositories
    - Choose -> Only select repositories **IMPORTANT**
    - Select your github repository
    - Click -> Approve & request for authorization
5.  **Create .travis.yml file**
    - Install travis package into your terminal
    - Go to your repository via terminal
    - Log in to Travis with command below
      - travis login --com
    - Create **.travis.yml** file manually or copy it from [this file](https://github.com/AckeeCZ/petrus/blob/master/.travis.yml)
    - Modify the file
      - Go to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
      - Log in with ackee credentials (acc on our ackee password storage)
      - Get access token from the ackee acount (each user MUST create his own token, it CAN NOT be shared)
      - Encrypt the token with travis encryption command
        - travis encrypt YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN --add deploy.api_key --com
      - Set encrypted api key into you **.travis.yml** file
    - Add/change repository name in the **.travis.yml** file
    - Set _tags: true_ (only publish when flag set in commit)
6.  **Push .travis.yml file into you repository**
7.  **Check results** - [Travis dashboard](https://travis-ci.com/dashboard)
8.  **Put building information badge into the README.md file in your repository**
    - Get inspired here - [https://github.com/AckeeCZ/petrus/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/AckeeCZ/petrus/blob/master/README.md)
9.  **If anything went wrong => call your favourite TL :))**
